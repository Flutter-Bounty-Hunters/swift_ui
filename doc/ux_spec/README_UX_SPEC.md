# UX Specification
The `swift_ui` package is only as good as its UX specification. 

A UX specification describes the size, shapes, colors, fonts, gestures, text input, and accessibility requirements for every widget, screen, and flow. This directory holds the UX specification for the `swift_ui` package, which represents the best efforts of the contributors to observe and log what they see in real Swift UI interfaces.

Carefully inspecting and logging UX specifications is one of the most time and effort-intensive tasks associated with this package. It would be a big help if you could contribute actionable UX specifications to this directory. Check the repository Issues to find out what this project needs.

## What to Inspect
Even the simplest Swift UI views have a surprising number of behaviors that need to be inspected and logged. Here are some hints to get you started.

Layout Specifications:
 * What happens when it has no children?
 * What happens if it has one child vs two children?
 * What happens if it has too many children to fit the available space?
 * Does it fill available space, size itself intrinsically, or both based on circumstance?
 * Does the layout apply any padding, margin, spacing? If so, how much? Do any of those values change based on the size of the layout?
 * What happens if the layout that you're inspecting is used inside of various other layouts? Does it behave as expected?
 * The OS can make content larger or smaller for easy viewing purposes - does changing that OS setting impact the layout?
 * Does it scroll/pan? If so, what are the rules for scrolling dynamics and overscroll?
 * Do gestures have any impact on that layout? If so, which gestures, and what impact?
 * What's the traversal behavior and audio announcement behavior in accessibility mode?

Controls and Indicators:
 * Can it support arbitrary children (content), or does it only take specific types?
 * How does it respond when it has too much space, or too little space?
 * How does it respond when the aspect ratio of the available space is very different?
 * If it contains text, colors, shapes - where did those default configurations come from? How can they be changed?
 * Does the view include any margin, padding, or spacing? If so, what are the values? Do they change based on the size of the view?
 * The OS can make content larger or smaller for easy viewing purposes - does changing that OS setting impact the view?
 * Does Dark Mode and Light Mode impact the appearance?
 * Is there a hover effect? a press down effect? a release effect?
 * Does the appearance change depending on the parent or ancestor view? For example, buttons look very different depending on their container.
 * What's the traversal behavior and audio announcement behavior in accessibility mode?
