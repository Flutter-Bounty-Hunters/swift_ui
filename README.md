# The Mission
Provide a near pixel-perfect replica of Apple's Swift UI experience in Flutter.

This mission serves multiple purposes:

 * Show developers that Flutter is a great choice for iOS development.
 * Remove the Cupertino burden from the Flutter framework team so they can focus on the framework.
 * Demonstrate that the Flutter community can come together to solve large problems.
